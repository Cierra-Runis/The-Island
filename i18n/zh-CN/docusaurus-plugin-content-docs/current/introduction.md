I wouldn't expect you to believe the world I'm about to describe, although your reading these words means you're already here. Maybe you've been in this world for a while but just discovered the island. Or maybe, like it was for me, the island is your introduction to this world. If you're alone, confused, and scared out of your mind, then you're exactly where I was on my first day. This world can seem like a maze and, sometimes, like a bully. But the truth is that it's a teacher and its trials are just lessons in disguise.

That's why I've left this book behind—so my journey can help you with yours.
