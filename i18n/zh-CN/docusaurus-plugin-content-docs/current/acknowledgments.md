To Jack Swartz, who first introduced the Brooks family to Minecraft.

To the folks at Mojang, Lydia and Junk, for letting me play in their sandbox.

To Ed Victor, who, as always, continues to believe in me.

A BIG thank you to Sarah Peed, the Spock to my Kirk.

To my wife, my beacon, Michelle.

And finally to my mom, who, long ago, thought it would be a good idea to read a book called _Robinson Crusoe_ to her son.
